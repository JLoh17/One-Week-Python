########## PYTHON NUMBERS ##########

# Integers - whole numbers only, no decimal points (unbounded starting in Python 3 meaning the number can go as long as you want)
# Int cannot start with a 0
# Float - with a decimal point (they are bounded) (e.g. 0.8 or even .8)
# Takes more memory to do more math with floats

type(2)  # shows the type

# Python doesn't use the comma separator. For humans, we can use the underscore to see clearer 1_000 = 1,000

# Operators are special characters in Python that perform operations on values such as +, -, *, /, ==, and, or, not etc.

print(1 and 4)  # 4

# ** is exponentiation
# "//" is integer divisio, it essentially rounds down
print(10 // 4)  # 2

# % is modulo - gives the reaminder; commonly used to determine odd or even
print(10 % 7)  # 3
